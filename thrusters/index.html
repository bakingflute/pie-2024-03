					<h2>Project Overview</h2>
					<p>Ghost Thrusters is the final project for class 'principles of integrated engineering (PIE)' aimed
						at developing a self-stabilizing drone using a
						reaction-control system.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					The goal of this project is to create a drone capable of maintaining its equilibrium position during
					flight through the use of pressurized air thrusters. Our focus was primarily on the stabilization
					capabilities, so we designed a non-flight-capable drone that, when suspended in the air by strings,
					self-adjusts its position. This approach allowed us to concentrate on the balance and control
					systems without the added complexity of flight, providing a solid foundation for future development.
				</p>
				<p>
					The development process involved a combination of electrical, mechanical, and software systems, each
					contributing to the drone's ability to stabilize itself. The electrical system was built around an
					ESP32 microcontroller, which interfaced with relays and solenoid valves to control the thrusters. An
					Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) was integrated to measure the drone's orientation and speed,
					providing real-time data critical for stabilization. On the mechanical side, we designed the
					structure of the drone to support the thrusters and accounted for the physics required to produce
					the precise amount of thrust needed for balance. This involved calculating forces and understanding
					the dynamics of airflow from the thrusters.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the software domain, we developed code to parse IMU readings using I2C communication and
					implemented PID control loops. These loops processed the IMU data to adjust thrust and
					counter-thrust, ensuring the drone maintained its equilibrium. Before constructing the four-thruster
					jig, we simulated the entire system in Python to test and refine the code. The simulation helped us
					identify potential issues and fine-tune the PID parameters, accelerating the development process and
					ensuring smooth integration of all components.
				</p>
				<p>
					By integrating the electrical, mechanical, and software systems, we created a cohesive prototype.
					The ESP32 controlled the relays and valves, while the IMU provided orientation data to adjust the
					thrusters. The mechanical design ensured proper thrust positioning, and Python simulations validated
					the code. This integration allowed the drone to stabilize itself when suspended in the air.
