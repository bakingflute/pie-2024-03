                <p>
                    In the first sprint of our drone development project, our team focused on exploring the concept of a
                    self-balancing drone. This process began with researching the topic, which involved watching
                    instructional videos and reading about the control theory underlying such systems. With a stronger
                    grasp of the concept, we proceeded to create initial sketches to visualize and refine the drone's
                    design.
                </p>

                                    alt="" /></span>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/sprint1/sketch2.png"
                                    alt="" /></span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The next step involved planning the testing of the electronics and software while determining a way
                    to start with a simple design and gradually build up to the final drone. Initially, we envisioned
                    creating a pendulum setup with a single thruster. However, as we explored the complexities of
                    achieving balance with just one thruster, we opted for a simpler approach: a seesaw mechanism with
                    two thrusters positioned at opposite ends.
                </p>

                <div class="box alt">
                    <div><span class="image fit system"><img src="images/sprint1/seesaw.jpeg" alt="" /></span> </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    To integrate the thrusters into the system, we designed a circuit featuring an Arduino board that
                    controlled two relays connected to solenoid valves. The valves were used to regulate the thrusters,
                    enabling the seesaw to achieve balance. To detect the orientation of the seesaw, we utilized an
                    Inertial Measurement Unit (MPU6050), which combines both an accelerometer and a gyroscope.


                </p>

                <div class="box alt">
                    <div><span class="image fit system"><img src="images/sprint1/test-jig.jpeg" alt="" /></span> </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Finally, we developed code to process the values received from the IMU via the I2C interface and
                    implemented a basic PID controller to balance the seesaw. The controller initially used only the
                    angle data to determine which thruster to activate. The final PID implementation controlled the
                    duration each thruster remained active to achieve precise balance.

                <p>
                    As we move forward, our next steps involve transitioning from the current two-thruster seesaw design
                    to a more complex four-thruster configuration. This development will build upon the insights and
                    experiences gained during this sprint. Additionally, we plan to address an electrical issue where
                    the Arduino board resets when the valves are toggled too quickly. This problem might be caused by
                    flyback voltage or electromagnetic interference (EMF) noise generated by the valves or relays.
