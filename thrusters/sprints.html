                <h2>Sprint 1</h2>
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/sprint1/sprint1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
                    In Sprint 1 of our drone development project, our team initially considered
                    creating a self-balancing drone with a single thruster designed to stabilize
                    the craft. However, recognizing the complexity of achieving balance with a
                    single thruster, we simplified our approach by implementing a seesaw mechanism
                    using two thrusters positioned at opposite ends. We created initial sketches featuring three
                    thrusters and tested our seesaw concept, successfully demonstrating its
                    viability. To enhance our prototypeâ€™s functionality, we integrated an
                    Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that provided real-time readings for a
                    single axis, effectively simulating pitch dynamics on a seesaw.
                    Our testing highlighted the principles of self-balancing, showcasing
                    our ability to adjust thrust in response to angular displacement,
                    setting a solid foundation for future developments.

                <h2>Sprint 2</h2>
                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/sprint2/sprint2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
                    In Sprint 2 of our drone development project, we successfully completed
                    the full mechanical assembly of the gas thruster reaction control system essential
                    for stabilizing the drone using compressed air. This involved integrating
                    key components such as disconnects, fittings, and tubing, alongside a compressor
                    and a regulating valve to effectively manage pressurized air, all culminating in a carefully
                    designed propelling nozzle. By mimicking the principles of rocket engines,
                    our project aims to develop a system that utilizes compressed air for attitude
                    and steering control. Additionally, we created a simulation
                    to test various parameters for the control system, allowing us to validate our
                    design choices before finalizing the mechanical and electrical components.
                    Looking ahead to demo day, we plan to implement four thrusters on a stationary
                    drone to enable it to maintain stability through IMU feedback and microcontroller commands.

                <h2>Sprint 3</h2>
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/sprint3/sprint3.png" alt="" /></span>
                    In Sprint 3 of our drone development project, we finalized our electrical
                    design and successfully implemented it, addressing minor issues in the
                    mechanical design related to the nozzles. We established a testbed for
                    evaluating the drone's balancing capabilities using a hanging setup,
                    recognizing the need to adjust it for comprehensive testing across all axes.
                    Additionally, we focused on refining our control loop by tuning the PID
                    parameters to achieve smoother balancing, transitioning from a thrust
                    application solely based on angle to one that also factors in velocity.
                    This iterative approach aims to enhance the drone's stability and responsiveness
                    as we move forward in the final stages of our development process.</p>
